# <%= packageName %>

This is the <%= description %> Bridge Chart Plugin.

### Usage

To build the plugin, run the following commands:

```
npm ci
npm run build
```

Alternatively, to run the plugin in development mode (=rebuilding whenever changes are made), start the dev server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

To add the package to Bridge, go to the `bridge-frontend` subdirectory in your Bridge source folder (assuming both the `<%= packageName %>` plugin and `bridge` repos are in the same root directory) and run
```
npm i -S ../../<%= packageName %>
```

After this edit the `bridge-frontend/src/visualizations/presets/MainPreset.js` and make the following changes:

```js
import { <%= packageLabel %> } from '<%= packageName %>';
```

to import the plugin and later add the following to the array that's passed to the `plugins` property:
```js
new <%= packageLabel %>().configure({ key: '<%= packageName %>' }),
```

After that the plugin should show up when you run Bridge, e.g. the development server:

```
npm run dev-server
```
